The world is set in a future where hamsters live freely in desert environments. The desert is their normal living space, where they move, hide, and build systems around their own needs. 

Since before, many of them or their ancesters were living as pet in human houses, now They build this recreated human living environment inside a controlled structure placed in the desert as an attraction. From the outside it looks like a contained habitat, but inside it functions as a themed experience. The room imitates human interiors, but it's actually redesigned for hamster use and entertainment.

So in this project the story is told as a promotional video made by hamsters. The tone treats the space as a tourist destination trying to attract visiters. I want highlights how anthropocentrism shapes environments for other animals, conmunities through this reversal, and how design logic carries forward even when the designer changes.
