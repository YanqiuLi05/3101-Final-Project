    <h1>WorldBuilding</h1>
    <p>At first my worldbuilding focused on a human centered system. The idea came from the way humans design nature for other species. We create artificial habitats, controlled environments, and themed experiences for animals, but often based on our own ideas of safety, comfort, and what nature should look like. This logic places humans at the top of the design process and assumes that other species fit into our structures.</p>
<p>Then as I thought maybe I can tell the same story from an animals perspective, how would hamster design the environment ? The human room became a recreated environment not for humans but for hamster exploration. Familiar human objects turned into an environment hamsters trying to recreate as an attraction.</p>
