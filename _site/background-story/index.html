    <h1>Background Story</h1>
    <p>The world is set in a future where hamsters live freely in desert environments. The desert is their normal living space, where they move, hide, and build systems around their own needs.</p>
<p>Since before, many of them or their ancesters were living as pet in human houses, now They build this recreated human living environment inside a controlled structure placed in the desert as an attraction. From the outside it looks like a contained habitat, but inside it functions as a themed experience. The room imitates human interiors, but it's actually redesigned for hamster use and entertainment.</p>
<p>So in this project the story is told as a promotional video made by hamsters. The tone treats the space as a tourist destination trying to attract visiters. I want highlights how anthropocentrism shapes environments for other animals, conmunities through this reversal, and how design logic carries forward even when the designer changes.</p>
