    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>I started the project by writing the script and deciding to frame the story as a commercial video made from a hamster perspective. This helped set the tone early and guided all later visual and technical decisions.</p>
<p>After the script I researched references and searched for assets that could support the idea. I looked for desert environments, architectural elements, tubes, wheels, and objects that could be read as both human interior design and hamster infrastructure.</p>
<p>Once I collected the assets I built three main scenes in Unity. The first scene is the desert environment. The second is a big human house placed inside a crystal ball structure. The third is the interior of the recreated human room. In this space I arranged the tubes, wheels, and smaller objects to create clear routes and an amusement like layout.</p>
<p>After the scenes were built I used Cinemachine in Unity to set up camera movements and keyframes. I recorded slow camera paths that function like a guided tour of the space, including wide shots, room flythroughs, and the full tube tour.</p>
<p>In the final stage I drew the hamster character and designed the dialogue box. Then I edited all the Unity footage together in Adobe Premiere Pro, added the character and text, and structured the video to feel like a short promotional commercial for the attraction.</p>
